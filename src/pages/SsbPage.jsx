        textTwo: `The Services Selection Board (SSB) is the official selection system used by the Indian Armed Forces to identify candidates with the personality, leadership potential, and officer-like qualities required to become commissioned officers. Unlike traditional examinations that primarily evaluate academic knowledge, the SSB interview is designed to assess a candidate’s behaviour, decision-making ability, emotional intelligence, communication skills, and leadership potential.
Through a structured five-day evaluation process, candidates are observed across psychological tests, group tasks, and personal interviews. The aim is to identify individuals who demonstrate the mindset, responsibility, and character required to lead troops and operate effectively in challenging environments.

                        <h2>Philosophy of SSB</h2>
                    </div>

                    <p className="ssb-philosophy-text">
                        The SSB selection system is based on behavioural assessment rather than theoretical testing.
                        The philosophy behind the process is that leadership potential cannot be accurately measured
                        through written examinations alone.
                    </p>

                    <p className="ssb-philosophy-text">
                        Instead, the SSB evaluates how candidates think, act, communicate, and interact with others
                        in different situations. By observing candidates across multiple activities, the board gains
                        a comprehensive understanding of their personality and suitability for military leadership.
                    </p>

                    <p className="ssb-philosophy-text">
                        The selection process focuses on identifying individuals who demonstrate initiative,
                        responsibility, cooperation, determination, and clarity of thought.
                    </p>

                    {/* ===== FIVE DAY PROCESS ===== */}
                    <div className="sct-title mb-4 text-center mt-5">
                        <h2>The Five-Day SSB Interview Process</h2>
                    </div>

                    <p className="ssb-philosophy-text">
                        The SSB interview process typically spans five days, during which candidates are assessed
                        through multiple evaluation methods. Each stage is designed to observe different aspects
                        of a candidate’s personality and behaviour.
                    </p>

                    <p className="ssb-philosophy-text">
                        Candidates are evaluated by three independent assessors:
                    </p>

                    <ul className="ssb-philosophy-list ">
                        <li>Psychologist</li>
                        <li>Group Testing Officer (GTO)</li>
                        <li>Interviewing Officer (IO)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p className="ssb-philosophy-text">
                        This multi-dimensional evaluation system ensures that a candidate’s personality is assessed
                        from different perspectives before the final recommendation is made.
                    </p>

                    {/* ===== IMPORTANCE ===== */}
                    <div className="sct-title mb-4 text-center mt-5">
                        <h2>Why Understanding the SSB Process Matters</h2>
                    </div>

                    <p className="ssb-philosophy-text">
                        Many candidates approach the SSB interview without fully understanding how the selection
                        process works. This often leads to confusion during group discussions, psychological tests,
                        and interviews.
                    </p>

                    <p className="ssb-philosophy-text">
                        Preparation for the SSB interview is not about memorizing answers or following shortcuts.
                        Instead, it involves developing self-awareness, leadership behaviour, communication skills,
                        and officer-like qualities expected from future leaders of the Armed Forces.
